# IRIS-Assignment
The app is quite similar to the one as shown in the tutorial but i can assure you it was made from scratch and i have tried my best and understood most of the things taught uptil now.
It contains all the features that has been taught till week 4.
You can navigate between pages, by cliking the card to a detail page and you can also add the given card to favourites from details page.
I have tried to explore different widgets and implemented some of them here.
I have integrated my app with hive and understood the concept of the same.
I have also started working on a transaction app and am trying to integrate everything that has been taught into it along with some of more stuff.
Thankyou for all your efforts.
